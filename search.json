    "text": "Abstract\n“Experiments were conducted in which Ss made classification, recognition, and similarity judgments for 34 schematic faces. A multidimensional scaling (MDS) solution for the faces was derived on the basis of the similarity judgments. This MDS solution was then used in conjunction with an exemplar-similarity model to accurately predict Ss’ classification and recognition judgments. Evidence was provided that Ss allocated attention to the psychological dimensions differentially for classification and recognition. The distribution of attention came close to the ideal-observer distribution for classification, and some tendencies in that direction were observed for recognition. Evidence was also provided for interactive effects of individual exemplar frequencies and similarities on classification and recognition, in accord with the predictions of the exemplar model. Unexpectedly, however, the frequency effects appeared to be larger for classification than for recognition.”\nLink to paper - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1826320/",

We would also be importing pdist and squareform from scipy.spatial.distance to calculate the pairwise distance and import MDS from sklearn.manifold to calculate the MDS values.\nLastly, we set the seed to ensure our (pseudo) random numbers are reproducible.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.manifold import MDS\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom scipy.spatial.distance import pdist, squareform\n\n\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\n\n\nFaces & Features\nNow that we have our dependencies sorted, we can start building. The very first thing we need to do is set the faces and features like the study does.\n\n\n\nfrom Nosofsky, 1991\n\n\nTo replicate this, we will create 10 faces with 4 features (e.g. eyes height, distance between eyes, nose length, etc). Nosofsky (1991) has defined the features but for our purposes we can move ahead with random features.\n\nn_faces = 10\nn_dims = 4\nfaces = np.random.rand(n_faces, n_dims)\n\n\nprint(\"Face feature matrix:\")\nprint(faces)\n\nFace feature matrix:\n[[0.37454012 0.95071431 0.73199394 0.59865848]\n [0.15601864 0.15599452 0.05808361 0.86617615]\n [0.60111501 0.70807258 0.02058449 0.96990985]\n [0.83244264 0.21233911 0.18182497 0.18340451]\n [0.30424224 0.52475643 0.43194502 0.29122914]\n [0.61185289 0.13949386 0.29214465 0.36636184]\n [0.45606998 0.78517596 0.19967378 0.51423444]\n [0.59241457 0.04645041 0.60754485 0.17052412]\n [0.06505159 0.94888554 0.96563203 0.80839735]\n [0.30461377 0.09767211 0.68423303 0.44015249]]\n\n\nAs you can see from the output, each row is a face, and each column is a different feature of the face. For example, if we consider the features to be aspects like Eye height, Eye separation, Nose length, and Mouth height, we can interpret the first face, which has the following values, as -\n[0.37454012 0.95071431 0.73199394 0.59865848]\nEye height ≈ 0.37 → slightly below mid level probably.\nEye separation ≈ 0.95 → appears to be wide.\nNose length ≈ 0.73 → likely a long nose.\nMouth height ≈ 0.60 → almost medium height.\nNote - I have mentioned features like eye height, nose length, etc. for the sake of comprehension, they are not inherently factored into the code\n\n\nPairwise Distance\nNext, we need to calculate the pairwise distance between every single row in the faces matrix. We would do so using the pdist function.\nIf faces is a matrix such that -\n\\[\n\\text{faces} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1 & x_2 & x_3 & x_4 \\\\\\\\\ny_1 & y_2 & y_3 & y_4 \\\\\\\\\nz_1 & z_2 & z_3 & z_4\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThen each row here represents a face with \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), \\(x_3\\), etc. representing a feature. Thus, pdist(faces) computes:\nDistance between Face 0 and Face 1.\nDistance between Face 0 and Face 2.\nDistance between Face 1 and Face 2 (and so on).\nThe pdist function uses Euclidean Distance by default which is calculated as -\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}\n\\]\nThe reason we are calculating the pair wise values (using Euclidean distance) is so that we can use the same for Multidimensional scaling, a dimension reduction method. You might be familiar with PCA as another dimension reduction method which uses correlation. I was surprised to learn that PCA and MDS at times can present with similar values.\nWe then run our code to get -\n\nface_dists = squareform(pdist(faces))\n\nWe then use the exponential decay function used by Nosofsky (1991) to simulate similarity and added noise from a normal distribution. Nosofsky (1991) used the following formula for the same -\n\\(s_{ij} = \\exp(-d_{ij})\\)\nWe also clip the range to ensure it’s clean and interpretable for our MDS. The last line prevents assymetry.\n\nsimilarity_matrix = np.exp(-face_dists) + np.random.normal(0, 0.05, face_dists.shape)\n\nsimilarity_matrix = np.clip(similarity_matrix, 0, 1)\n\nsimilarity_matrix = (similarity_matrix + similarity_matrix.T) / 2",
